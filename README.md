### Hello 👋

My name is Alan Vardy, I am a Senior Developer living on the beautiful West Coast of Canada. 

I love working remotely on backend Elixir services, and enjoy playing with Rust in my free time. I pride myself on being a high-output individual contributor who leaves code better than he finds it and actively improves the overall health of codebases.

Some of my values:
- Code quality and tests help us ship faster, not slower 🚢
- Tooling and linters prevent bikeshedding 🚲 🏚️
- Software is only a dumpster fire when we let it be one 🔥
- Continuous steady improvement over huge rewrites 🛠️
- Fixing small bugs today prevents large issues tomorrow 🐛
- Magical things happen when developers can work in uninterrupted chunks of time 🕙
- I'm paid well, and thus invest in myself and my tools 🚀
- Kindness is mandatory, not optional 🥰
- JavaScript needs to be fired into the sun 🌞

If our values align, be sure to drop me a line 😆
